## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project I have learned more about how to add a box shadow,how to alighn the card in the center of the page , how to create a responsive page and how to use the pseudo classes in the CSS style sheet
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<a href="#">HTML & CSS foundations</a>
```

```css
.blog_card {
  box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px 0px hsl(0, 0%, 0%);
}
```

```css
a:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}
```

### Continued development

In the future I will work on adding more animation when hovering over the card and make it responsive with the user

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flex box](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This helped me in using the flex box proberty in CSS style sheet. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [CSS Pseudo elements](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_elements.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand pseudo elements and how to add it in your code. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
